| Risk type (technical, project, business) | Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Probability (high, medium, low) | Impact (high, medium, low) |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Business                                 | If there isn't enough market for the product then it will automatically fail as it is crowdfunded.                                                                                                                                                                              | Medium                          | High                       |
| Project/Technical                        | The small scale development environment may not accurately emulate what happens with the large scale deployed application. We may be unable to detect before launch issues related to the scalability of the application.                                                       | Medium                          | High                       |
| Technical/Business                       | It may be necessary to scale the infrastructure dynamically with the number of users in order to keep costs low when the number of users decreases and usability high when the number of users increases.                                                                       | Medium                          | High                       |
| Technical                                | Passwords, as they are stored right now, constitute a major security concern, that may be exploited in case our security policy isn't aligned with modern standards.                                                                                                            | Medium                          | High                       |
| Project                                  | Not enough feedback from the application users may delay the detection of serious bug and the deployment of bug fixes.                                                                                                                                                          | Medium                          | High                       |
| Project                                  | Some change requests may make it necessary to modify the structures of the entities' attributes, making all the stored gas stations and/or users unusable anymore.                                                                                                              | Medium                          | High                       |
| Business                                 | Gas station managers may try to inflate competitor gas prices to gain an edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Medium                          | Medium                     |
| Business                                 | A competitor may develop a similar application to gain a share of our market if our application succeeds.                                                                                                                                                                       | High                            | Low                        |
| Project/Business                         | An inadequate number of admins may make it impossible to add all the necessary gas stations to the application before its launch. Even given enough personnel, it may be impossible to add every gas station with 100% accuracy without an official list made by a state agency | High                            | Low                        |
| Business                                 | Unforeseen crises or pandemics, like the COVID-19 one, may greatly reduce the amount of contributors to the application, ultimately killing it.                                                                                                                                 | Low                             | High                       |
| Technical                                | An inadequate infrastructure may annoy users, who would be unable to login or save prices in some high traffic moments.                                                                                                                                                         | Low                             | Medium                     |
| Technical                                | The user's GPS may be disabled, which may lead to a poorer overall experience with the product.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Low                             | Low                        |
