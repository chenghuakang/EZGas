Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
* Team working and collaboration with students with different backgrounds, skills and ideas.
* Remote meetings, simulating real world smart working conditions.
* Hands on experience with industry standard tools for long distance cooperation 
* Applying in practice software development processes and techniques
* Improving programming skills thanks to more experienced teammates.
* Using a tool, such as CATME, to guarantee the creation of fair and balanced teams of students.
* Improving analysis skills by developing requirements and design documents.
* Acquiring familiarity with testing techniques (Black Box and White Box) in a non-trivial scenario.
* Learning a modern and extensively used framework such as Spring Boot

# Worst things
* Impossibility of completing certain deadlines without sacrificing time allocated to other courses or projects.
* Seeming lack of empathy and understanding of the professor and the teaching assistants when presented with problems related to the pressure that this project put on most of the students. 
* Struggle to get even a simple answer from the teacher and the teaching assistants on Slack. The only way to get an answer in a timely manner was to ask it during the live lecture and hoping that the lecturer would address it (which thankfully always happened).
* Extremely annoying changes to the code in the last deadline, made for apparently no reason (Premium Diesel). It felt like this was added just to punish the students for choosing the easiest change requests (which our group DID NOT). This made it necessary to rewrite a great number of tests, while gaining absolutely no useful knowledge in the meantime.

# Suggestions 
* Reducing the scope of the application and focusing more on the techniques and maybe provide some practical experience also with a deployment simulation.
* Providing lessons on the Spring Boot framework before requiring its use as if it is obvious for everybody.
* Being more considerate when planning and scheduling the project, especially in a crisis situation like the one we faced this year, which made it difficult for some student to follow all of the courses, let alone also work on the project, with an upsetting lack of support and tight time constraints.
