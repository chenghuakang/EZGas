Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
Team working and collaboration with each other with different backgrounds, skills, thought and ideas which happen during the regular project, the best point that makes this project very interesting is that all meeting took place in remote like a real project in the world.
Simulating and get experiences the long-distance co-operation among the team members as well as co-operating and managing the project using useable software and tool like Git and Trello, etc.
Become familiar with all standards & processes of making software from scratch.
Improving programming language skills by collaborating with other team members, they have different abilities in various programming languages.
Using a web-based tool such as CATME to managing student teams and divide the students into several groups instead of doing by themselves. It is a fair mechanism because all teams consist of members with various experience in programming languages.
Improving the ability to analyze requirements and difficulties in practical ways.
Simulating the real scenario of processing the software.
Become familiar with testing (Blackbox & Whitebox) in practical ways instead of theoretical and its related tools.


# Worst things
Time, there is a lack of time of doing the projects with heavy and multiple parts that required more time and effort to accomplish them despite having different courses and also exams.

not feasible to choose the language of programming and framework freely,.there was strick mode of using java language.despite of its power but more complexity and rule-based than any other language which required more experience in it that members must-have. instead, using JavaScript and its libraries to develop this web application was more useful especially students who had a course in parallel like (web application) which they have discussed it and have had the opportunity to use it in this course's project and let them get more experiences.

Even simple changes in the code lead to modify the documents (such as requirement) and testing which is a very time-consuming activity and it happens in this project exactly in the final step of the project and causes a lot of issues.

# Suggestions 
Moving one step further, if there is sufficient time, to deploy the project into the server which gives the students the opportunity to become familiar more with the deployment phase.

Teaching new technologies which are the core part of the project in advance and during the course, such as Spring Boot or MVC framework, before using them in the project.

As above mentioned, Do not force the language and framework and giving the options to the students especially if they have learned a new one in another course in parallel.

Consider other factors in the planning and scheduling especially when a crisis has happened which caused most students to have had remaining exams which lead to being not able to participate in the project.
